2. **Responsibility for Contributing to Society**: Every citizen is responsible for contributing to the development and welfare of society, either through active participation in community services, public works, and other forms of civic engagement or through making a monetary contribution in lieu of active service. The form and extent of these contributions should aim to ensure fairness and equality amongst all citizens.

5. **Responsibility for Dependents**: Every citizen is responsible for their dependents' welfare and financial support. This includes ensuring adequate provision for basic needs such as food, clothing, healthcare, and education.

## Government Responsibilities

The government of Pactum has a responsibility to provide essential services, which include:

1. **Responsibility for Defence**: The state has an obligation to maintain forces and measures sufficient to protect its citizens and territories from external threats.

2. **Responsibility for Maintaining Justice**: The state has an obligation to establish and maintain a fair legal system that ensures justice is administered impartially, by a jury of peers, and equitably for all citizens, regardless of their status or background.

3. **Responsibility for Environmental Protection**: The state protects the environment for future generations.

4. **Responsibility for Regulatory Governance**: The state regulates various sectors to ensure fair practices, preventing the concentration of power (including the government itself), protecting consumers, and ensuring that the rights and responsibilities outlined herein are respected and fulfilled.

Each of these responsibilities comes with inherent accountability. The government must exercise these powers in a way that respects the rights and freedoms of the citizens and is accountable to the citizens for its actions. Thus, while the government has the power to perform these functions, it also has the responsibility to do so in a manner that is transparent, accountable, and respects the rights of the citizens.
