# Policy on Education

This policy provides a framework for the provision of education within Pactum. It underscores the responsibilities of parents and guardians, the role of private education providers, the function of insurance in ensuring access to education, and the government's role in setting educational standards.

## 1. Parental Responsibility

Parents and guardians have the primary responsibility for the education of their children. This includes selecting and overseeing educational methods and resources, monitoring progress, and ensuring that their children receive an appropriate and effective education.

## 2. Private Education Providers

Private providers operate the education sector within Pactum. Parents and guardians have the freedom to select the provider that best meets the needs and preferences of their children, either providing the education themselves or through private tuition if they wish.

## 3. Non-Discrimination

All educational services and insurance providers must adhere to a policy of non-discrimination. Education and insurance must be available regardless of a child's race, religion, gender, socioeconomic status, or other characteristics.

## 4. Special Education Needs

Children with special education needs must be catered to within this system. Insurance providers must cover the additional costs associated with special education, and education providers must meet certain accessibility and inclusivity standards.

## 5. No Government-Provided Schools

In keeping with our commitment to individual responsibility and freedom of choice, the government does not operate schools or educational institutions. Private entities provide all educational services.

## 6. Education Insurance

Recognizing the importance of ensuring access to education for all children, regardless of their parent's financial circumstances, it is required that all parents maintain an education insurance policy. This policy must cover the costs of educating their children if they cannot do so. Only insurance providers that adhere to the principles and regulations of Pactum will be permitted to offer education insurance policies within our jurisdiction.

## 7. Basic Education Requirements

While parents and guardians have significant discretion in the choice of education for their children, the government stipulates certain basic requirements that all educational programs must meet. This includes:

   - **Mathematics**: Proficiency in fundamental arithmetic, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

   - **English**: Proficiency in English, emphasising reading comprehension, writing clearly, and effective oral communication.

   - **Science**: Basic understanding of key scientific principles and the scientific method.

   - **Charter Comprehension**: Familiarity with the Charter of Rights and Responsibilities, understanding its principles and implications.

These requirements aim to ensure that all citizens of Pactum have the foundational skills and knowledge needed to be productive, informed, and responsible members of society. The parents or guardians are responsible for ensuring their dependents meet these requirements, enabling them to contribute meaningfully to the community and thrive in their individual endeavours.

## 8. Vocational and Adult Education

Provisions are in place for vocational education and training and adult education. Lifelong learning is encouraged, and citizens can update their skills and knowledge through private providers at various points in their lives.

## 9. Home Education

If parents or guardians choose to educate their children at home, they are free to do so, provided they meet the Basic Education Requirements outlined by the government.
