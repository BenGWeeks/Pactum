# Pactum

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for Pactum, where we maintain our foundational governing documents. This repository serves as a source of truth, reflecting our core principles and the social contract between the state and citizens.

## Contents

- [Charter of Rights and Responsibilities](./CharterOfRightsAndResponsibilities.md): Our foundational document outlines citizens' essential rights and responsibilities of both the state and citizens. This charter is the bedrock of the future society.

- [Updates](./Updates.md): Keep track of all amendments and important updates to our governing documents.

- [Additional Rules and Regulations](./Rules_Regulations.md): Comprehensive source of supplementary laws and regulations that shape our society.

## Contribution

We believe in the power of collective decision-making. While this is not an open-source project in the traditional sense (namely, it is not currently computer code), we value the principles of transparency, participation, and collaboration. Check out [Contribution Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on how you can contribute to the evolution of our governing documents.

## Resource

This repository serves as a resource for future citizens of Pactum and the global community interested in this governance model. We believe in learning from each other to create more fair, free, and prosperous societies.
